GettingandCleaningDataProject
=============================

<p> This repo contains the script run_analysis.R that processes data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones data set and produces a tidy dataset. The original data set should be downloaded from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.</p>

<p>If the script is located in a directory in your computer, the original data should be stored in the following relative path to that directory:  "./UCI HAR Dataset/". Just unzip the data with the directory structure as stored in the downloaded .zip file.</p>

<p>In order to run the script, set your working directory in R to the directory where the script is located (or use the full path) and type 'source("./run_analysis.R")' from the R prompt. </p>

<p> The script will create the file Final_dataset.txt in you working directory. It also will let a final_dataset data.frame in the memory of your R session. </p>

<p> More information can be found in codebook.md and in the script's inline comments (which separate the code in 5 parts corresponding to the 5 points of the project instructions).</p>
