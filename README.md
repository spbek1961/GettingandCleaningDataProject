GettingandCleaningDataProject
=============================

<p> Contains the script run_analysis.R that processes data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones data set (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) and produces a tidy dataset</p>

<p>If the script is located in a directory in your computer, the original data should be stored in the following relative path to that directory:  "./UCI HAR Dataset/"</p>

<p>To run the script set your working directory in R to the directory where the script is located (or use the full path) and type source("./run_analysis.R") from the R prompt.

<p> The script will create the file final_dataset in you working directory. It also will let a final_dataset data.frame in the memory of your R session. </p>

<p> More information can be found in codebook.md and in the script's comments.</p>
